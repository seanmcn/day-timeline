# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Day Timeline!

This is a personal project I built for my own use, so I'm not actively seeking contributors or aiming to grow it into a community-driven tool. That said, you're welcome to:

- **Fork it** and make it your own, seriously, go wild
- **Open a PR** if you've built something you think might be useful here

Just know that I may be slow to respond, and I'll only merge things that fit how I personally use the app. No hard feelings if I don't take your contribution. It's not you, it's just that this is my weird little tool for running my weird little days.

If you do fork it and build something cool, I'd love to hear about it.
